**a. Introduction to Image Processing Filters and their Importance in Computer Vision:**

Image processing filters are essential tools in computer vision, used to enhance, modify, or extract features from images. Filters are convolutional operations that apply a small matrix (kernel) to the pixels of an image. They help in noise reduction, edge detection, feature extraction, and image enhancement, which are crucial in various computer vision tasks like object recognition, image segmentation, and image restoration.

Image processing filters play a significant role in computer vision because they allow us to preprocess images and extract meaningful information from raw visual data. By filtering out noise and enhancing relevant features, computer vision algorithms can work more accurately and efficiently, leading to better performance in tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous driving.

**b. Description of Each Filter and Its Theoretical Principles, Advantages, and Disadvantages:**

**1. Blur Filter:**
   - Theoretical Principles: The blur filter is a low-pass filter that smoothens the image by averaging pixel values within the kernel. It reduces high-frequency components, blurring the image and reducing noise.
   - Advantages: Blurring helps remove noise, reduces details, and simplifies the image, making it useful for applications like background removal or image segmentation.
   - Disadvantages: It might also blur important details and edges, leading to loss of information.

**2. Gaussian Filter:**
   - Theoretical Principles: The Gaussian filter is a type of blur filter, but it uses a weighted kernel based on the Gaussian distribution. It assigns higher weights to central pixels and lower weights to neighboring pixels.
   - Advantages: The Gaussian filter provides better control over the amount of blurring, and its weighted nature preserves edges better than a simple blur filter.
   - Disadvantages: While it reduces noise and smoothens the image, it can still cause some loss of fine details.

**3. Median Filter:**
   - Theoretical Principles: The median filter is a non-linear filter that replaces the pixel value with the median value of neighboring pixels within the kernel.
   - Advantages: The median filter effectively removes impulse noise (salt-and-pepper noise) without blurring edges or details.
   - Disadvantages: It might not be as effective in reducing other types of noise, and larger kernels can result in slower processing.

**4. Bilateral Filter:**
   - Theoretical Principles: The bilateral filter is an edge-preserving filter that takes into account both the spatial distance and intensity difference between pixels.
   - Advantages: The bilateral filter effectively smoothens the image while preserving edges, making it suitable for noise reduction without sacrificing important details.
   - Disadvantages: The bilateral filter can be computationally intensive, especially with larger kernels, and might not remove all types of noise effectively.

**c. Mathematical Equation of Each Filter and Its Practical Application:**

**1. Blur Filter:**
   - Mathematical Equation: Output_pixel = (1/(kernel_size^2)) * sum_of_all_pixels_within_kernel
   - Practical Application: Blurring an image to reduce noise and prepare it for further processing like object detection or recognition.

**2. Gaussian Filter:**
   - Mathematical Equation: Output_pixel = (1/(2*pi*sigma^2)) * exp(-(x^2 + y^2)/(2*sigma^2))
   - Practical Application: Smoothing an image while preserving edges, commonly used in image processing tasks like computer graphics.

**3. Median Filter:**
   - Mathematical Equation: Output_pixel = median_of_all_pixels_within_kernel
   - Practical Application: Removing salt-and-pepper noise from images, commonly used in image restoration and denoising applications.

**4. Bilateral Filter:**
   - Mathematical Equation: Output_pixel = (1/(2*pi*sigma_d^2)) * exp(-((x-x_i)^2 + (y-y_i)^2)/(2*sigma_d^2)) * (1/(2*pi*sigma_r^2)) * exp(-((I_i-I)^2)/(2*sigma_r^2))
   - Practical Application: Smoothing an image while preserving edges and reducing noise, often used in applications like real-time video denoising and image editing.

In conclusion, image processing filters are crucial tools in computer vision, enabling noise reduction, feature extraction, and image enhancement. Each filter has its theoretical principles, advantages, and disadvantages, making them suitable for various image processing tasks. Understanding their mathematical equations and practical applications helps computer vision engineers choose the appropriate filters for specific scenarios to improve the accuracy and efficiency of computer vision algorithms.
